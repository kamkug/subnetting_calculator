# subnetting calculator class

The program is meant to return a network ID, first address, last address and a broadcast address
for an IP address in question. 

For running the program python3.6 version is going to be compatible (this is the only version I have tested it on).
On top of a standard library you would need to have TKinter package installed as well to be able to use
the program display window. 

TKinter can be obtained in a following way (worked for me anyway) :

for Ubuntu 18.04:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

for RedHat 8.0.1:
```
yum install python3-tkinter
```

You might have a problem with your display, this could be a solution for you (right at the bottom) :

I am intending to do a little bit more polishing on this particular program but its functionality is pretty much
where I wanted it to be (at least at the moment).

Thanks for your interests :)
