# subnetting calculator class

At the moment just a subnetting calculator class.

Right now you can get network id, first address, last address, addresses count and a broadcast
address for any IPv4 network while instantiating the class. The only method is via CLI right now.

It is going to change and more functionality will be added, but for now it is more or less
working as intended.
