# subnetting

Only the prototype/test version of my subnetting_calculator.

At the moment you can get network id, first address, last address and a broadcast
for any IPv4 network that you will input inside of the file as address1.

It is going to change and more functionality will be added, but for now it is at 
least working as intended.
