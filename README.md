# Subnetting calculator

Author: Kamil Kugler

The program is meant to return a network ID, first address, last address and a broadcast address
for an IP address in question. 

If you are a fan of a GUI and do not much of CLI, you can use a cli_subCal.py without any inputs to get a tkinter
pop-up window. Its functionality is similar but does not provide a JSON formattet output file (as of now).

You could also select to use runCalculator.py to run a CLI version of a software and create a JSON output file
using a predefined JSON formatted input file. Just run the command for proper usage.

Python3.6 version is going to be perfect to run this program(hence this is the only version I have tested it on).
On top of a standard library you would require to have TKinter package installed as well (if you prefer to use 
a display window).

TKinter can be obtained in a following way (can also look into tkinter docs):

for Ubuntu 18.04:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

for RedHat 8.0.1:
```
sudo yum install python3-tkinter
```

If you are having a problem with your display, this could be a solution for you (right at the bottom of the article) :

I am intending to do a little bit more polishing on this particular program but its functionality is pretty much
where I wanted it to be (at least at the moment).


Thanks for your interests :)

p.s. It is not meant to be used for profits (if you would like to use it in your work environment please do it at your own risk). I mean have had a lot of fun while creating this program but it does not mean it is pitch perfect either :P
